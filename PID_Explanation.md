# Why PID Might Be N/A in this context

A Persistent Identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. PIDs are commonly used in digital repositories to ensure that the cited resource can always be found, even if its location changes. Examples of PIDs include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), and Handles.

## Why PID Might Not Be Applicable

In the context of our exercise and dataset herein the PID might not be applicable due to the following reasons:

- **Dataset Source:** The dataset did not come with a pre-assigned PID if it was not published in a repository that assigns PIDs.
- **Manual Assignment:** If you are using a local or manually collected dataset, you might not have assigned a PID to it yourself.

## When PID is Applicable

- **Official Repositories:** If we were using datasets from repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad, they typically assign DOIs to datasets.
- **Academic Publications:** Data associated with academic publications often have DOIs.
- **Institutional Repositories:** University or organizational repositories may assign PIDs to ensure long-term access.
